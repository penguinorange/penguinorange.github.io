        <h1>The Occult of Igor Stravinsky</h1>

        <p>Igor's music makes people throw chairs in public.
            I'm not talking about your run of the mill rabble rousers;
            I'm talking about your hoity toity charlatans!  </p>

        <h2>The Problems with the Rite of Spring</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The dancers lacked grace</li>
            <li>The orchestra was too loud</li>
            <li>The musical dissonance was too alien</li>
            <li>The French are hostile to innovation that isn't their own</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stravinsky in the World</h3>

        <p>Stravinsky was good friends with Pablo Picaso, but that didn't
            help him with the french in 1921 (or whenever it was). He also had 
            some beef with this cat, Schoenberg, over some truly ugly
            music (THEY WERE USING ALL 12 NOTES IN THE SCALE, YUCK!), but I think that might
            be a Russian-German problem, rather than a case of artistic differences.
            The crowning achievement of this musical mastermind was that he managed
            to find himself as Coco Chanel's boy toy.
